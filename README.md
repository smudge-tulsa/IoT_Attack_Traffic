BOTNET ATTACKS

Botnet attacks occur when large numbers of machines have been taken over by an attacker. Each machine is turned into a “bot” or “zombie”. Botnets have been around since the 1990’s and continue to grow increasingly fast. Names of some past botnets: Bagle, Storm, Kraken, and Mantis.
	Types of attacks 
  	Botnet attacks typically involve stealing data, sending large quantities of spam and phishing emails, or launching massive DDoS (distributed denial of service) 
    attacks.
  Several common attacks are DDoS (distributed denial of service), credential theft, spamming and phishing and ad fraud.
  
ANALYZING DATA USING ETL METHOD

Do you want to gather and analyze botnet data using the ETL method?  You got it!
  Locate a dataset.
  Use Pandas (Jupyter notebook) to extract raw data from the dataset and to transform raw data into a readable table.
    This can help sort which botnet is benign or malicious, therefore prioritize critical threats to be eliminated.
  The readable table can then be loaded into a PGAdmin database.
  
ETHICS

Botnets are considered unethical because they are created by cyber criminals to misuse data.  This project is not unethical because data was only used to analyze, transform and load into a database to store for current and/or future use.
